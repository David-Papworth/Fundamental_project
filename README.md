## Introduction
The object of the project was “To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training”.

This means I had to make a website with create, read, update and delete functions and perform tests to make sure the site was working to the specifications.

### Requirements
* A Trello board
* A database with at least 2 tables, with at least a one-to-many relationship.
* A detailed risk assessment. 
* A functioning CRUD application using python.
* Automated test units 
* A working front-end website using Flask
* Integration into a Version Control System (Github)
