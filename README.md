## Introduction
The object of the project was “To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training”.

This means I had to make a website with create, read, update and delete functions and perform tests to make sure the site was working to the specifications.

### Requirements
* A Trello board
* A database with at least 2 tables, with at least a one-to-many relationship.
* A detailed risk assessment. 
* A functioning CRUD application using python.
* Automated test units 
* A working front-end website using Flask
* Integration into a Version Control System (Github) 

### My Idea
My idea for this project was to create a website where people could add Warhammer figures and armies so they could organise what they own and set up the armies they use. 

### User Stories
The first step was to create user stories to plan what needed to be done and why. As well as getting a better perspective on the project.

* As a customer, I want to add a new set of figures, so I can update my collection. (*)
* As a customer, I want to view my figures, so I know what I own. (*)
* As a customer, I want to change the number of the figures I own, so I can keep up do date with what I own. (*)
* As a customer, I want to remove figures, as I have sold or don’t own anymore. (*)
* As a customer, I want to add a new army, so I can organise the armies I will use. (*)
* As a customer, I want to view my armies, to see what armies I have. (*)
* As a customer, I want to change my armies, so I keep my armies up to date. (*)
* As a customer, I want to remove armies, as I have stopped using them. (*)
* As a customer I want a add my figures into an army, to plan armies I will use. (*)
* As a customer, I want to view an army list that shows all the figures that are part of that army, so I can see what each are contains. 

(*) = user stories to complete crud functionality 

### My Plan 
* Create a home page that shows the figures you own.
* Add an update and delete button for every figure added (on the home page). 
* Create a add figure page.
* Make a add figure form.
* Create a view army page that shows the armies you own.
* Add an update and delete button for every army added (on the view army page). 
* Create a add army page.
* Make a add army form.
* Create unit tests for all pages as well for the CRUD functions. 
* Create Integration tests for at least one method.
